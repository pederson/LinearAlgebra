# LinearAlgebra
Basic linear algebra routines and classes optimized for ease of use
- Matrices and Vectors
- Sparse Matrices and Vectors
- Get a basis for a vector space via QR (Gram-Schmidt, Householder, Givens, Randomized method)
- Compute matrix decomposition (LU, ILU, SVD, Cholesky, QR)
- Perform eigenvalue decomposition (Lanczos, Arnoldi, QR Algorithm)
